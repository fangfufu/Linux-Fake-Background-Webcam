# Linux-Fake-Background-Webcam

## Background
Video conferencing software support for background blurring and background
replacement under Linux is relatively poor. The Linux version of Microsoft
Team does not support background blur. Over at Webcamoid, we tried to figure out
if we can do these reliably using open source software
([issues/250](https://github.com/webcamoid/webcamoid/issues/250)).

This repository started of as a tidy up of Benjamen Elder's
[blog post](https://elder.dev/posts/open-source-virtual-background/). His
blogpost described a background replacement solution using Python, OpenCV,
Bodypix neural network, which is only available under Tensorflow.js. The scripts
in Elder's blogpost do not work out of box. This repository originally provided
a turn-key solution for creating a virtual webcam with background replacement
and additionally foreground object placement, e.g. a podium.

Over time this repository got strangely popular. However it has been clear over
time that Bodypix is slow and difficult to set up. Various users wanted to use
their GPU with Tensorflow.js, this does not always work. The extra code that
provided GPU support sometimes created problems for CPU-only users.

Recently Google released selfie segmentation support for
[Mediapipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/releases/tag/v0.8.5). This
repository has been updated to use Mediapipe for image segmentation. This
significantly increased the performance. The older version of this repository
is now stored in the ``bodypix`` branch.

The performance improvement introduced by
[2f7d698](https://github.com/fangfufu/Linux-Fake-Background-Webcam/commit/2f7d6988a3275b8aa4cbc73bed8151666c5aedef)
means that you can get at least 25FPS on an i7-4900MQ.

## Prerequisite
You need to install either v4l2loopback or akvcam. This repository was
originally written with v4l2loopback in mind. However, there has been report
that v4l2loopback does not work with certain versions of Ubuntu. Therefore 
support for akvcam has been added.

### v4l2loopback
The v4l2loopback kernel module can be installed through the package manager of
your Linux distribution or compiled from source following the instructions in
the [v4l2loopback github repository](https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback).

Once installed, the module needs to be loaded. This can be done manually for
the current session by running

    $ sudo modprobe v4l2loopback devices=1 exclusive_caps=1 video_nr=2 card_label="fake-cam"

which will create a virtual video device `/dev/video2`, however, this will not
persist past reboot. (Note that the `exclusive_caps=1` option is required for
programs such as Zoom and Chrome).

To create the virtual video device on startup, run the `v4l2loopback-install.sh`
script to create `/etc/modules-load.d/v4l2loopback.conf` to load the module and
`/etc/modprobe.d/linux-fake-background.conf` to configure the module.

The camera will appear as `fake-cam` in your video source list.

If you get an error like
```
OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument
```

when opening the webcam from Python, please try the latest version of
v4l2loopback from the its
[Github repository](https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback), as the version
from your package manager may be too old.

#### Ubuntu 18.04
If you are using Ubuntu 18.04, and if you want to use v4l2loopback, please
compile v4l2loopback from the source. You need to do the following:
1. Remove the ``v4l2loopback`` package
    - `sudo rmmod -r v4l2loopback`
    - `sudo apt-get remove v4l2loopback-dkms`
2. Install DKMS and the Linux kernel headers
    - ``sudo apt-get install dkms linux-headers-`uname -r` ``
3. Install v4l2loopback from the repository
    - `git clone https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback.git`
    - `cd v4l2loopback`
4. Install the module via DKMS
    - `sudo cp -R . /usr/src/v4l2loopback-1.1`
    - `sudo dkms add -m v4l2loopback -v 1.1`
    - `sudo dkms build -m v4l2loopback -v 1.1`
    - `sudo dkms install -m v4l2loopback -v 1.1`
5. Load the module
    - `sudo modprobe v4l2loopback`

This may apply for other versions of Ubuntu as well. For more information,
please refer to the following Github
[issue](https://github.com/jremmons/pyfakewebcam/issues/7#issuecomment-616617011).

### Akvcam
To install akvcam, you need to do the following:
1. Install the driver by following the instruction at
[Akvcam wiki](https://github.com/webcamoid/akvcam/wiki/Build-and-install). I
recommend installing and managing the driver via DKMS.
2. Configure the driver by copying ``akvcam`` to ``/etc/``. Please note that the
configuration file I supplied locks your Akvcam instance
to a resolution of 1280x720. It is different to the configuration file
automatically generated by Webcamoid, as my configuration locks the input/output
colour format of Akvcam.
3. Note down the output of ``ls /dev/video*``.
4. Run ``sudo modprobe akvcam`` or make the akvcam start with a system:
``sudo akvcam-install.sh``
5. Akvcam should have created two extra ``video`` devices.
6. When running ``fake.py``, you need to set ``-v`` to the first video device
that Akvcam created, e.g. if Akvcam created ``/dev/video5`` and ``/dev/video6``,
you need to set ``-v /dev/video5``.
7. The software that uses the virtual webcam should the second device that
Akvcam created, e.g. if Akvcam created ``/dev/video5`` and ``/dev/video6``,
you need to set the software to use ``/dev/video6``.

Note that in ``akvcam/config.ini``, ``Akvcam (Output device)`` is the  device
that ``fake.py`` outputs to, and ``Akvcam (Capture device)`` is the "capture
device", which is opened by the software that you want to use the virtual webcam
with.

You might have to specify the ``--no-ondemand`` flag when using Akvcam.

For more information on configuring Akvcam, please refer to
[Akvcam wiki](https://github.com/webcamoid/akvcam/wiki/Configure-the-cameras)

### Disabling UEFI Secure boot
Both v4l2loopback and Akvcam require custom kernel module. This might not be
possible if you have secure boot enabled. Please refer to your device
manufacturer's manual on disabling secure boot.

### Python 3
You will need Python 3. You need to have pip installed. Please make sure that
you have installed the correct version pip, if you have both Python 2 and
Python 3 installed. Please make sure that the command ``pip3`` runs.

In Debian, you can run

    sudo apt-get install python3-pip

I am assuming that you have set up your user environment properly, and when you
install Python packages, they will be installed locally within your home
directory.

You might want to add the following line in your ``${HOME}/.profile``. This line
is needed for Debian Buster.

    export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin":$PATH


### Upgrading pip
Mediapipe requires pip version 19.3 or above. (Please refer to
[here](https://pypi.org/project/mediapipe/#files) and
[here](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux)). However, the pip distributed with
some Linux distributions is outdated, e.g.
[Debian Buster](https://packages.debian.org/buster/python3-pip).

If you are on Debian Buster please make sure ``.local/bin`` is in your ``PATH``.
You can make sure this is the case by adding:

    PATH="$HOME/.local/bin":$PATH

in your ``~/.profile``.

You can then upgrade pip by running:

    pip3 install --upgrade pip

## Installation
The actual installation can be done by simply running

    ./install.sh

### Installing with Docker
The use of Docker is no longer supported. I no longer see any reason for using
Docker with this software. However I have left behind the files
related to Docker, for those who want to fix Docker support.
Please also refer to [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md). The Docker related files were
provided by [liske](https://github.com/liske).

Docker made starting up and shutting down the virtual webcam more convenient
for when Bodypix was needed. The ability to change background and foreground
images on-the-fly is unsupported when running under Docker.

## Usage
In the terminal window, do the following (if using v4l2loopback) :

    python3 fake.py

You configure it using a ini file, see `./config-example.ini`.
To run with a config file, use the following command:

    python3 fake.py -c ./config-example.ini

The files that you might want to replace are the followings:

  - ``background.jpg`` - the background image
  - ``foreground.jpg`` - the foreground image
  - ``foreground-mask.jpg`` - the foreground image mask

By default this program uses on-demand processing. The program processes images
from the real webcam only when there are programs using the fake webcam. If
there are no programs reading from the fake webcam, this program disconnects the
real webcam, pauses processing and outputs a black image at 1 FPS to reduce CPU
usage. You can manually toggle between the paused/unpaused state by pressing
``CTRL-C``. Unpausing the program also reload the files listed above. This
allows you to replace them without restarting the program. You can disable the
on-demand processing behaviour by specifying the ``--no-ondemand`` flag.

Note that animated background is supported. You can use any video file that can
be read by OpenCV.

### fake.py
``fakecam.py`` supports the following options:
```
usage: fake.py [-h] [-c CONFIG] [-W WIDTH] [-H HEIGHT] [-F FPS] [-C CODEC]
               [-w WEBCAM_PATH] [-v V4L2LOOPBACK_PATH] [--no-background]
