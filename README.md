# Linux-Fake-Background-Webcam

## Background
Video conferencing software support for background blurring and background
replacement under Linux is relatively poor. The Linux version of Zoom only
supports background replacement via chroma key. The Linux version of Microsoft
Team does not support background blur. Over at Webcamoid, we tried to figure out
if we can do these reliably using open source software
([issues/250](https://github.com/webcamoid/webcamoid/issues/250)).

Benjamen Elder wrote a
[blog post](https://elder.dev/posts/open-source-virtual-background/), describing
a background replacement solution using Python, OpenCV, Tensorflow and Node.js.
The scripts in Elder's blogpost do not work out of box. In this repository, I
tidied up his scripts, and provide a turn-key solution for creating a virtual
webcam with background replacement and additionally foreground object placement,
e.g. a podium.

Unlike the original blog post this can work with CPU-only. It checks for the presence
of `/dev/nvidia0` to determine if there is a GPU present. By
downscaling the image sent to bodypix neural network, and upscaling the
received mask, this whole setup runs sufficiently fast under Intel i7-4900MQ.

## Prerequisite
You need to install either v4l2loopback or akvcam. This repository was
originally written with v4l2loopback in mind. However, there has been report
that v4l2loopback does not work with certain versions of Ubuntu. Additionally,
the author has never really managed to get v4l2loopback to work with Google
Chrome. Therefore support for akvcam has been added.

### v4l2loopback
If you are on Debian Buster, you can do the
following:

    sudo apt install v4l2loopback-dkms

I added module options for v4l2loopback by creating
``/etc/modprobe.d/v4l2loopback.conf`` with the following content:

    options v4l2loopback devices=1  exclusive_caps=1 video_nr=2 card_label="v4l2loopback"

``exclusive_caps`` is required by some programs, e.g. Zoom and Chrome.
``video_nr`` specifies which ``/dev/video*`` file is the v4l2loopback device.
In this repository, I assume that ``/dev/video2`` is the virtual webcam, and
``/dev/video0`` is the physical webcam.

I also created ``/etc/modules-load.d/v4l2loopback.conf`` with the following content:

    v4l2loopback

This automatically loads v4l2loopback module at boot, with the specified module
options.

If you get an error like
```
OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument
```

when opening the webcam from Python, please try the latest version of
v4l2loopback from the its
[Github repository](https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback),
as the version from your package manager may be too old.

#### Ubuntu 18.04
If you are using Ubuntu 18.04, please be aware of the following additional
instruction:
1. remove apt package
    - `sudo modprobe -r v4l2loopback`
    - `sudo apt remove v4l2loopback-dkms`
2. install aux
    - `sudo apt-get install linux-generic`
    - `sudo apt install dkms`
3. install v4l2loopback from the repository
    - `git clone https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback.git`
    - `cd v4l2loopback`
    - `make`  # The other commands are not needed
4. instal mod
    - `sudo cp -R . /usr/src/v4l2loopback-1.1`
    - `sudo dkms add -m v4l2loopback -v 1.1`
    - `sudo dkms build -m v4l2loopback -v 1.1`
    - `sudo dkms install -m v4l2loopback -v 1.1`
5. reboot
    - `sudo reboot`

This may apply for other versions of Ubuntu as well. For more information,
please refer to the following Github
[issue](https://github.com/jremmons/pyfakewebcam/issues/7#issuecomment-616617011).

### Akvcam
To install akvcam, you need to do the following:
1. Install the driver by following the instruction at
[Akvcam wiki](https://github.com/webcamoid/akvcam/wiki/Build-and-install). I
recommend installing and managing the driver via DKMS.
2. Configure the driver by copying ``fakecam/akvcam`` to ``/etc/``, for more
information, please refer to
[Akvcam wiki](https://github.com/webcamoid/akvcam/wiki/Configure-the-cameras)

The configuration file I supplied was originally generated by Webcamoid, I
added the ``rw`` attributes to do the virtual camera devices. If you already
have already configured akvcam via webcamoid, you need to modify the
``/etc/akvcam/config.ini`` to add the ``rw`` attributes.

### Disabling UEFI Secure boot
Both v4l2loopback and Akvcam require custom kernel module. This might not be possible 
if you have secure boot enabled. Please refer to your device manufacturer's manual 
on disabling secure boot. 

### Python 3
You will need Python 3. You need to have pip installed. Please make sure that
you have installed the correct version pip, if you have both Python 2 and
Python 3 installed. Please make sure that the command ``pip3`` runs.

In Debian, you can run

    sudo apt-get install python3-pip

I am assuming that you have set up your user environment properly, and when you
install Python packages, they will be installed locally within your home
directory.

You might want to add the following line in your ``.profile``. This line is
needed for Debian Buster.

    export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin":$PATH
configuration files yourself.

### Node.js
You need to have Node.js. Node.js version 12 is known to work. To install
Node.js, please follow the instructions at
[NodeSource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md).

## Installation
Simply run

    ./install.sh

### Installing with Docker
Please refer to [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md). The updated Docker related files were
added by [liske](https://github.com/liske).

Using Docker is unnecessary. However it makes starting up and shutting down the virtual webcam very easy and convenient.
The only downside is that the  ability to change background and foreground images is slightly more complicated and
has some limitations.

## Usage
Assuming you are not using the Docker version, overriding the ports settings, please also make sure that your
TCP port ``127.0.0.1:9000`` is free, as we will be using it.

You can change the port by setting the environment variable PORT. If you set a path, it will use a UNIX Socket instead.

You need to open two terminal windows. In one terminal window, do the following:

    cd bodypix
    node app.js

In the other terminal window, do the following:

    cd fakecam
    python3 fake.py

The files that you might want to replace are the followings:

  - ``fakecam/background.jpg`` - the background image
  - ``fakecam/foreground.jpg`` - the foreground image
  - ``fakecam/foreground-mask.jpg`` - the foreground image mask

If you want to change the files above in the middle of streaming, replace them
and press ``CTRL-C``

### fakecam/fake.py
Note that animated background is supported. You can use any video file that can
be read by OpenCV.

If you are not running fake.py under Docker, it supports the following options:

    usage: fake.py [-h] [-W WIDTH] [-H HEIGHT] [-F FPS] [-S SCALE_FACTOR]
                [-B BODYPIX_URL] [-w WEBCAM_PATH] [-v V4L2LOOPBACK_PATH]
                [--akvcam] [-i IMAGE_FOLDER] [-b BACKGROUND_IMAGE]
                [--tile-background] [--no-foreground] [-f FOREGROUND_IMAGE]
                [-m FOREGROUND_MASK_IMAGE] [--hologram]

### bodypix/app.js
If under/over-segmentation occurs, you can tweak ``segmentationThreshold``. To
make the network run faster, you can change ``internalResolution``, however this
will reduce segmentation accuracy. Both and other variables can be changed by
exposing them via environment variables before running bodypix. See the bodypix
[manual](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/body-pix/README.md)
for detailed information about these.

```
BPHFLIP     - Horizontal flip [ true, false ]
BPIRES      - Internal Resolution [ 0.0, 1.0 ]
BPMULTI     - Multiplier [ 0.0, 1.0 ]
BPOUTSTRIDE - Output Stride [ 8, 16, 32 ]
BPQBYTES    - Quantization bytes [ 1, 2, 4 ]
BPSEGTHRES  - Segmentation Threshold [ 0.0, 1.0 ]
```

#### Compilation of Tensorflow C library
Tensorflow.js uses Tensorflow C library. The default version shipped with
Tensorflow.js is most likely not optimised for your CPU. For me, it gives me
warnings that it was not compiled ``AVX2`` and ``FMA`` instructions. Compiling
a version of Tensorflow C library that is optimised for your CPU will improve
the performance. For me, it improved the framerate.

In order to compile your own Tensorflow C library, please follow the instruction
at [TENSORFLOW.md](TENSORFLOW.md)
